# binary-search-tree
BinarySearchTree class written in Java

This repo contains the code for a BinarySearchTree data structure. This data structure is represented as a binary tree in which the left subtree is a BST containing all items less than the root, and the right subtree is a BST containing all items more than the root. It is useful as an implementation for a sorted set that can be searched, inserted into, and deleted from in O(height(T)), where height(T) ranges from log(N) to N. The BinarySearchTree is implemented by using a class called Binary Node, which contains pointers to its children.

The BinarySearchTree.java file also contains three different iterators for the class, the most useful of which is the in-order iterator.
